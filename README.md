# SortMethod
In This Repo I program different type Of Sort Algorithm 


```sh
Sorting algorithms

```sh
Best Algorithm 

The time complexity of Quicksort is O(n log n) in the best case, O(n log n) in the average case, and O(n^2) in the worst case.
But because it has the best performance in the average case for most inputs,

```
```sh
Quicksort is generally considered the “fastest” sorting algorithm.
```
```sh
At the end of the day though, whatever the best sorting algorithm really is depends on the input (and who you ask).

```
