# SortMethod
In This Repo I program different type Of Sort Algorithm

```sh
Best Algorithm 

The time complexity of Quicksort is O(n log n) in the best case, O(n log n) in the average case, and O(n^2) in the worst case. But because it has the best performance in the average case for most inputs, Quicksort is generally considered the “fastest” sorting algorithm.

At the end of the day though, whatever the best sorting algorithm really is depends on the input (and who you ask).
